It just occurred to me that we could speed up the computation of P_n for generating sets containing 0 by computing the nth dilate iteratively on S \ {(0, 0, 0)}.

We could maybe generalize this to any set where there's some (0, 0, z) vectors?
Compute the... hm. I think we can do this. Let S' be the generating set with all
the z-vectors removed. Now... Compute the dilates P_k(S') for k = 1, 2, ..., n.
For k = 1, ..., n - 1, shift up P_k(S') by z_1 + ... + z_(n - k) for some
nonzero z values that you can get in S.

This might not be that much faster if you don't have zero. Ugh.
